# password_bank
First Personal Python Project to create a password bank using a GUI and cryptography libraries
Currently, the project is only a simple register and login page. Future rennovations will include having a database 
to store a user's password (will start with only one user, than multiple users), which is implemented with tkinter
and combine both the database and login page together to create a somewhat working program
